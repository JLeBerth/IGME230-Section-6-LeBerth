# Internet Feud
### Compete against the internet to find the real answers to the worlds most pointless questions.
## Genre
The genre of Internet Feud is Trivia/Partygame, heavily following the style of the real life trivia show "Family Feud" The purpose of the game will be to guess the most answered responses of the other users of the web app. 
## Platform
Internet Feud is moving forwards with a mobile-friendly intent, while Desktop will be the main focus of the design once content and style are finalized a mobile alternative will be added to allow easier mobile use, flattening the screen horizontally making everything a more brief list.
## Story
Players will be motivated by one of several possible desires. Playing through the game they will have an initial choice, do they wish to try to attain the highest score by guessing the most answered responses, or do they wish to change the flow of the web apps history by inputting their own seperate answers to try to skew the game answers to their will.

This Initial decision will determine how they play through the game, while simply inputting short words or phrases they will put their mind to the test or create a challenge for future and recurring players.

As time goes on the story of the app itself will progress as old questions are archived and new questions are rotated in, with initial surveys done to always allow players to experience the quiz portion without limiting them to dictating the answers, a page featuring questions of the past and their single most popular answer presented without context will stay there hopefully standing the test of time, this in turn will prompt players to react to something as abstract as "answer random questions" with a sense of importance or nostalgia as they watch how the discourse takes shape and can look back upon previous interaction, and look forward to future jokes or stories created by the game.
## Aesthetics
Clean rounded style, no large amount of images required. For use on mobile devices instead of a large chart of answers, a thin bounded list displayed in an appealing manner is all that is needed for top answers. As the games content is largely text based use of a clear simple font is important, as anything that effects legibility will ruin the experience of those who cannot read it.
## Gameplay
Mouse or touch screen to select answer box, and to agree or disagree with top answers.
Keyboard and phone keypad to input answers.

Players will progress through ten current questions in a slew of simple phases.

### The Question Phase
Players are presented the question in large font on the screen, it shrinks to the top of the page revealing an answer box.

### The Answer Phase
Players are presented a box to input an answer into, if able to be implemented the app will compare like answersand combine them into single categories. After submitting an answer through clicking or tapping on a "Finished" Button The top ten answers are presented with an x and a checkmark next to them, if the player inputted one of the top ten answers, they recieve a number of points equal to however many votes that answer currently has.

###The Voting Phase
Players can click the x or check next to each answer rating them, each check counting as though the player had enterred that answer in themselves, and each x counting as though one less player had enterred it. After all ten top answers are voted on, or a player clicks a next question button below the list they progress to the next question.

Once all questions have been answered the player will be greeted with a end screen showing their score, and the top current score, as well as a link to the webpage featuring previous archived questions and answers.

### Player Learning and Teaching the Game
The rules of the game being fairly brief, and easily explainable in a shorter more simplistic way for the average player then what is above will be seperate from the webapp's page itself, the page that leads into the app if the user doesn't use a direct link will have the rules and functions of the game listed before the link into the game. Use of visual clues and the English language will allow players who decide the explanation was too long, and didn't read it, will figure out approximately what is going on as they progress through the phases, even if they don't understand the context which the questions are being asked in.

As there are different reasons one may use the app meta learning such as strategies would not be readily evident, however if certain players do wish to rally behind specific answers apart from their own thoughts, it would evolve into a discourse outside of the webapp itself, as the depth of game functions is fairly shallow.

## Other and About the Dev
Hi, My name is Jacob LeBerth, I am majoring in Game Design and Development, with an immersion in Creative Writing, I like making things, regardless of whether the end result turns out good or bad the process of creation always yields new experiences and lessons. When thinking about what I wanted to create as a webapp I knew i wanted to build upon the point of multi user interaction as that is the largest most obvious benefit of posting the app to run on the internet. A few moments later deciding to add humor to it brought me along this path.
